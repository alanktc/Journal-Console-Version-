A little simple project made using C++ and C++/MySQL connector. 
I connected this little thing to a MySQL database using XAMPP so I can easily access the database through my web browser.


It can WRITE simple text entries that has their own timestamp of when they are written.

It can also LIST down any and all written entries and you can READ them by inputting the corresponding entry ID.

Lastly, you can DELETE the entries.
